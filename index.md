## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="ng.jpg">

Hi! I'm a Ph.D candidate at [Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/). 
I study the dynamics of the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies to understand 
its formation history and what can it tell us about Dark Matter. I am
particularly interested in modeling the interaction between the Milky Way and 
its more massive satellite, the Large Magellanic Cloud. I use N-body simulations 
and numerical methods to build Milky Way gravitational potentials. Currently, I am 
working with Professor Gurtina Besla.
